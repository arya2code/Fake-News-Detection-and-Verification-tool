🛡️ TruthGuard – AI-Powered Fake News Detection & Verification System

Infosys Springboard Milestone Project
Building trust in digital information using AI, NLP & Deep Learning

📌 Overview

TruthGuard is an AI-powered misinformation detection and verification platform designed to analyze news articles, claims, and online content in real time.
The system classifies content as Reliable, Suspicious, or Fake, verifies claims using trusted fact-checking sources, and provides explainable insights through an interactive dashboard.

With the rapid spread of misinformation across social media and digital platforms, TruthGuard aims to support safer decision-making, public awareness, and information integrity.
